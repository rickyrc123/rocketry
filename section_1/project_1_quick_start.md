# Project 1: Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started in 15 Minutes

This guide will help you get your rocket simulator up and running quickly.

### Step 1: Understanding the Project Structure

```
project_1_starter.py      # Your main implementation file (template)
project_1_rocket_simulator.md  # Detailed project specification
```

### Step 2: Pick Your First Implementation Target

Choose ONE of these to start with:

#### Option A: Minimal Viable Simulator (Recommended)
- Implement `ConstantThrust` class
- Basic `Rocket` with mass and drag
- Simple `Environment` with constant gravity
- Euler integration in `RocketSimulator`
- Basic trajectory plot

#### Option B: Focus on Thrust Profiles
- Implement all thrust profile classes first
- Create visualization of different thrust patterns
- Then add physics simulation

#### Option C: Visualization First
- Start with `TrajectoryPlotter` class
- Create compelling plots with dummy data
- Then build simulation to generate real data

### Step 3: Your First 30 Lines of Code

Here's a minimal starting point (choose what to implement first):

```python
# In ConstantThrust class:
def __init__(self, thrust: float, burn_time: float):
    self.thrust = thrust
    self.burn_time = burn_time

def get_thrust(self, t: float, state: np.ndarray) -> float:
    return self.thrust if t < self.burn_time else 0.0

def is_active(self, t: float) -> bool:
    return t < self.burn_time
```

### Step 4: Test Early and Often

Create a simple test after every few functions:

```python
# Quick test example
def test_basic_functionality():
    thrust_profile = ConstantThrust(1000.0, 10.0)
    print(f"Thrust at t=5: {thrust_profile.get_thrust(5.0, None)}")
    print(f"Thrust at t=15: {thrust_profile.get_thrust(15.0, None)}")
```

### Step 5: Choose Your Physics Complexity

**Level 1 (Start Here):**
- Point mass rocket
- Constant gravity
- No atmosphere
- 2D motion only

**Level 2 (Add Later):**
- Variable mass (fuel consumption)
- Atmospheric drag
- Altitude-varying gravity

**Level 3 (Advanced):**
- Rotational dynamics
- Wind effects
- Multi-stage rockets

### Step 6: Visualization Strategy

**Minimum Viable Plot:**
```python
def plot_trajectory(self, results):
    x = results['states'][:, 0]  # x position
    y = results['states'][:, 1]  # y position
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.xlabel('Downrange (m)')
    plt.ylabel('Altitude (m)')
    plt.title('Rocket Trajectory')
    plt.show()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips

### State Vector Design
Start simple, expand later:
```python
# Level 1: [x, y, vx, vy, mass]
# Level 2: [x, y, vx, vy, mass, theta]
# Level 3: [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, mass, phi, theta, psi, wx, wy, wz]
```

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Print everything**: Add debug prints to see what's happening
2. **Start with known solutions**: Test against simple analytical cases
3. **Plot intermediate results**: Visualize forces, accelerations, etc.
4. **Use small time steps**: Ensure numerical stability

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Units**: Stick to SI units throughout (meters, seconds, kg)
- **Coordinate systems**: Be consistent with your reference frame
- **Initial conditions**: Start with reasonable values
- **Time steps**: Too large = instability, too small = slow simulation

## 🚀 Quick Win Examples

### Example 1: Vertical Launch
```python
# Simple vertical rocket with constant thrust
rocket_config = RocketConfig(
    initial_mass=1000,  # kg
    thrust=15000,       # N
    burn_time=60        # s
)
```

### Example 2: Gravity Turn
```python
# Add small initial angle for gravity turn
initial_angle = 5 * np.pi / 180  # 5 degrees from vertical
```

### Example 3: Multi-Stage
```python
# Two-stage rocket
stage1 = ConstantThrust(20000, 120)  # High thrust, short burn
stage2 = ConstantThrust(5000, 300)   # Lower thrust, long burn
```

## 📊 Success Metrics for Week 1

By the end of your first week, you should have:
- [ ] A rocket that launches vertically
- [ ] Realistic trajectory (goes up, then comes down)
- [ ] Basic plots showing trajectory
- [ ] Clean, readable code structure
- [ ] One working thrust profile type

## 🎨 Make It Your Own

### Personalization Ideas
- **Theme**: Design for specific rocket (Falcon 9, Saturn V, your own design)
- **Use case**: Launch to orbit, Mars mission, suborbital tourism
- **Analysis focus**: Efficiency optimization, safety analysis, cost modeling
- **Visualization style**: Technical plots, artistic rendering, interactive GUI

### Extension Directions
- **Real-time simulation**: Update plots as simulation runs
- **Parameter sensitivity**: How do changes affect performance?
- **Mission planning**: Find optimal trajectories for specific goals
- **Educational tool**: Interactive learning about rocket physics

## 💡 Getting Unstuck

### If You're Stuck on Physics
- Start with simpler models (no drag, constant gravity)
- Look up example problems in textbooks
- Compare with analytical solutions for simple cases

### If You're Stuck on Code Structure
- Implement one class at a time
- Use print statements liberally
- Start with hardcoded values, add flexibility later

### If You're Stuck on Visualization
- Start with basic line plots
- Add one plot type at a time
- Focus on clarity over aesthetics initially

## 🎯 Remember the Goal

Your ultimate deliverable is a **trajectory plotter with thrust profile support**. Everything else is extra credit. Focus on:

1. **Getting something working** (even if simple)
2. **Making it work reliably** (handle edge cases)
3. **Making it useful** (good plots, easy to use)
4. **Making it yours** (add personal touches)

Start coding and have fun building your rocket simulator! 🚀
